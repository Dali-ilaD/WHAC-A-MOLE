## Game Summary

This project is my version of ‘Wack-a-mole’.
 This version will incorporate aspects of the classic arcade game as well as some aspects of typing games that you might find online.
  When opening up the game on your browser, you’ll be presented with the game board, as well as a difficulty option. 
  The game play involves the player hitting a keyboard key to wack the corresposding mole(holding the corresponding keyboard key). 
  The player will have ‘x’ amount of lives, and when the player misses a mole, the lives decrement. 
  When the player is out of lives, the game is over and they are presented with their score, as well as the highscore record.

## Functionality 

‘Wack-a-mole’ players will be able to:
* Start the game when they are ready
* Select a difficulty level
* Set a high score record
* Test their reaction time
* *and of course* **Wack moles with their keyboard!**
